    1. Diabetes Dataset (Frame 1) ü©∫
Description:
This dataset contains medical features used to predict diabetes. The goal is to predict whether a patient has diabetes (outcome 1) or not (outcome 0) based on various medical attributes. ü©ª

    Used Methods:

Logistic Regression: A linear classification model used to predict diabetes.

Grid Search: Used to tune the hyperparameters of the model for better performance.

Decision Tree: A tree-based model used to classify the data.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A neighborhood-based classification algorithm.

Random Forest: A powerful ensemble model based on multiple decision trees. üå≥

    Features:

Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies the patient has had.

Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration after a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test.

BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure.

SkinThickness: Skin thickness (in mm).

Insulin: Insulin level after the 2-hour glucose tolerance test.

BMI: Body Mass Index.

DiabetesPedigreeFunction: A function that measures the effect of family history on diabetes risk.

Age: Age of the patient.

Outcome: Whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

    2. Housing Price Dataset (Frame 2) üè†
Description:
This dataset contains features of houses used to predict housing prices. The goal is to predict the median house value based on physical and environmental factors. üè°

Used Methods:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A neighborhood-based algorithm used to predict house prices.

Standard Scaler: Used to standardize the features, bringing them to a common scale.

Random Forest: An ensemble model using multiple decision trees to predict housing prices.

Grid Search: Used to find the optimal hyperparameters for the models. üîç

    Features:

CRIM: Crime rate.

ZN: Proportion of residential land zoned for large lots.

INDUS: Proportion of industrial land.

CHAS: Charles River proximity (0: not near, 1: near).

NOX: Nitrogen oxide concentrations.

RM: Average number of rooms in the house.

AGE: Proportion of houses built before 1940.

DIS: Distance to employment centers.

RAD: Proximity to radial highways.

TAX: Property tax rate.

PTRATIO: Pupil-teacher ratio.

LSTAT: Proportion of lower status population.

MEDV: Median house value (in thousands of dollars).


    3. Penguin Dataset (Frame 3) üêß
Description:
This dataset contains physical characteristics of different penguin species. The goal is to predict the species of a penguin based on its physical traits. üê¶

    Used Methods:

Random Forest: An ensemble model based on decision trees used to classify penguin species.

Grid Search: Used for hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.

Logistic Regression: A linear model used for classification.

Standard Scaler: Used to standardize features for model efficiency. üîÑ

    Features:

species: The species of the penguin (e.g., "Adelie", "Gentoo", "Chinstrap").

island: The island where the penguin is found.

culmen_length_mm: Length of the penguin's bill (in mm).

culmen_depth_mm: Depth of the penguin's bill (in mm).

flipper_length_mm: Length of the penguin's flipper (in mm).

body_mass_g: Body mass of the penguin (in grams).

sex: The sex of the penguin ("MALE" or "FEMALE").
